# Is Safari?

A whole dedicated package to checking if the browser is running Safari (webkit). :)

If it really seems like it would useful, I can publish similar packages for other browsers or a small set of functions in one package.

# Installation

```bash
npm install @humanfriend22/is-safari
```

# Usage
```javascript 
import isSafari from '@humanfriend22/is-safari';

// Boolean
const browserIsSafari = isSafari();
```
